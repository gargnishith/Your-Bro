a APP that will help a person to go through the gym session/solo travel covering podcasts(search), popular podcast (integration with other channels of podcast like spotify), and MVP is to give a detailed description about contents to i have to listen and ask for how much time(max 45 min) we have to generate the audio content and in which language. 
user can set the tone of the podcast also as what it would be like as analytics, more like professor, debate(as what was wrong what was not) by using a slider giving the ratio of each category try to make a triangle and three vertices resembling three categories as cursor will move the slider in triangle and calculate the ratio accordingly and user can also directly select any category is only one is required by clicking on that. and passing the ratio of selected point in triangle which governs the ratio and if one selected make that 100% rest 0% and include the content requested by user and create a prompt.
and if possible give links to popular podcast on spotify and other platfomrs(what other platforms that i have to search. what they use in US, UK)

for text generation create two type of functions one with open AI one with and ollama using mistral model so i could change according to my use. (name it as /contentGenerate in UI) in backend i will switch function for API wether ollama or open AI
for voice generation also 2 function one with open AI one with ollama(whatever model is best for voice generation) so i could change according to my use.(name it as /voiceGenerate in UI) in backend i will switch function for API wether ollama or open AI


instead of slider in tone of speech 
will be giving radio options among 
1) give podcast(analytical, debateful as will be discussing downfall, negative, comeback, positive things)
2) story reading/telling(user shpuld feel like they are reading a book which is written by very great author) 
3) lesson in the class(it shoule be rich in content, only factual, user feel like attending a class in Harward, MIT school in his/her undergraduation)
remove slider and do the modifications accordingly
